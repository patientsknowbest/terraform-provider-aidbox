# aidbox_gcp_service_account (Resource)
The `GcpServiceAccount` resource is a proprietary, custom resource used by Aidbox. It stores the email address of a Google Cloud Platform service account, allowing Aidbox to impersonate that account using workload identity.

This resource is most commonly referenced by other resources, such as `aidbox_sdcconfig`, to grant Aidbox access to GCP services like Google Cloud Storage buckets.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
resource "aidbox_gcp_service_account" "sa_account" {
  name                      = "aidbox-sa"
  service_account_email = "sa-email@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

### Usage with SDCConfig

```terraform
resource "aidbox_gcp_service_account" "sa_account" {
  name                      = "aidbox-sa"
  service_account_email = "sa-email@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}

resource "aidbox_sdcconfig" "default_storage_config" {
  name    = "forms-storage"
  default = true

  storage {
    bucket = "attachment-store-test"
    account {
      reference = "GcpServiceAccount/${aidbox_gcp_service_account.sa_account.id}"
    }
  }
}
```
